## How to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication & authorization?
We have built an Omniauth strategy for Xero OAuth 2.0. Check out [omniauth-xero-oauth2](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-oauth2-omniauth-strategy)

Follow these steps to create your Xero app

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "Try oAuth2" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (this is your callback url - localhost, etc)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. Your secret is now hidden.

### How to use the xero-ruby SDK
This is a barebones example showing how to create an account from Xero via this SDK

```
# Load the gem
require 'xero-ruby'

# Setup authorization
XeroRuby.configure do |config|
  # Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: OAuth2
  config.access_token = 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN'
end

api_instance = XeroRuby::AccountingApi.new
xero_tenant_id = 'xero_tenant_id_example' # String | Xero identifier for Tenant
account = { "Code":"123456", "Name":"Foobar", "Type":"EXPENSE", "Description":"Hello World" } # Account | Request of type Account

begin
  #Allows you to create a new chart of accounts
  result = api_instance.create_account(xero_tenant_id, account)
  p result
rescue XeroRuby::ApiError => e
  puts "Exception when calling AccountingApi->create_account: #{e}"
end
```

## TLS 1.0 deprecation
As of June 30, 2018, Xero's API will remove support for TLS 1.0.  

The easiest way to force TLS 1.2 is to set the Runtime Environment for your server (Tomcat, etc) to Java 1.8 which defaults to TLS 1.2.
